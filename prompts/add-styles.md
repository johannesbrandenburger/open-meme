# Propmt to add styles to the app since this is a task an llm should be able to do.

I created this meme app but with no styling yet.
Add beautiful tailwind styles to each page and component.
Be careful to be consistent! The Background should only be defines once and also the other styles and elements should look consistent.
The round for example should be shown in the top right in a nice view.
You can also adjust the texts to be more user friendly and also you can add loading states (displaying a pressed button as loading example: when started a game and waiting for the server response).
Just don't change any other logic!

Theme: Use a beautiful gradient background like bg-linear-to-br from-purple-400 via-pink-500 to-red-500. Also use blur effects to make the UI look more modern.
Most important: It should be a mobile-first design! So keep things simple and compact! Do not use ugly emojis, rather use something like lucide for icons.

TailwindV4 and lucide-react are already configured correctly! Do not use any other libraries for styling as shadcn/ui or similar.
